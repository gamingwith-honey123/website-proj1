            The Solar System[b] is the gravitationally bound system of the Sun and the objects that orbit it, either
            directly or indirectly.[c] Of the objects that orbit the Sun directly, the largest are the eight planets,[d]
            with the remainder being smaller objects, the dwarf planets and small Solar System bodies.
            Of the objects that orbit the Sun indirectly—the natural satellites—two are larger than the smallest planet,
            Mercury.[e]

                Solar system was formed 4.6 million years ago from the gravitational collapse of a giant interstellar molecular
                cloud. The vast majority of the system's mass is in the Sun, with the majority of the remaining mass contained
                in Jupiter. The four smaller inner planets, Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars, are terrestrial planets, being
                primarily composed of rock and metal. The four outer planets are giant planets, being substantially more massive
                than the terrestrials. The two largest planets, Jupiter and Saturn, are gas giants, being composed mainly of
                hydrogen and helium; the two outermost planets, Uranus and Neptune, are ice giants, being composed mostly of
                substances with relatively high melting points compared with hydrogen and helium, called volatiles, such as
                water, ammonia and methane. All eight planets have almost circular orbits that lie within a nearly flat disc
                called the ecliptic.

                        The Solar System also contains smaller objects.[f] The asteroid belt, which lies between the orbits of Mars and
                        Jupiter, mostly contains objects composed, like the terrestrial planets, of rock and metal. Beyond Neptune's
                        orbit lie the Kuiper belt and scattered disc, which are populations of trans-Neptunian objects composed mostly
                        of ices, and beyond them a newly discovered population of sednoids. Within these populations, some objects are
                        large enough to have rounded under their own gravity, though there is considerable debate as to how many there
                        will prove to be.[9][10] Such objects are categorized as dwarf planets. The only certain dwarf planet is Pluto,
                        with another trans-Neptunian object, Eris, expected to be, and the asteroid Ceres at least close to being a
                        dwarf planet.[f] In addition to these two regions, various other small-body populations, including comets,
                        centaurs and interplanetary dust clouds, freely travel between regions. Six of the planets, the six largest
                        possible dwarf planets, and many of the smaller bodies are orbited by natural satellites, usually termed "moons"
                        after the Moon. Each of the outer planets is encircled by planetary rings of dust and other small objects.

                        The earth and other planets revolve around it and it furnishes light, heat and energy for our solar system. It
        is 13, 92,520 km in diameter and 14, 95, 97,900 km distant from the earth. Sun rays travel at a speed of about
        300,000 km per second and take. Now it has been proven that solar system is continously moving. So we don't hava
        the exact size of the solar system
